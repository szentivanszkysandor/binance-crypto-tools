  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 20, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>“Binance – Crypto Tools”</strong> Chrome extension provides a simple launcher for crypto dashboards:
    a pinned Binance link and a <em>Tools</em> section with buttons that open your GitHub‑hosted mini‑apps (e.g. Order Book,
    Trades, Volume, Price/EMA, Pattern Scanner, Macro/Crypto Risk). The extension itself does not analyze, collect, transmit,
    or sell personal data. It only opens links and stores your custom buttons locally.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an independent, unofficial project and is <strong>not affiliated with Binance</strong>. The dashboards are for
    educational and informational use only and do not constitute financial advice.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>storage:</strong> Save your custom links (label + URL) in <code>chrome.storage.sync</code> so they can optionally sync with your Google account if Chrome Sync is enabled.</li>
    <li><strong>tabs:</strong> Open the selected links in a new browser tab.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No content scripts, host permissions, or analytics are used by this extension.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Custom links:</strong> If you add buttons, their labels and URLs are stored in <code>chrome.storage.sync</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>No personal data:</strong> The extension does not collect names, emails, wallets, balances, or browsing history.</li>
    <li><strong>No transmission:</strong> Settings remain in Chrome storage; nothing is sent to external servers by the extension.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Third‑Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> Your dashboards are hosted by GitHub Pages or other sites you configure. Their use is governed by those sites’ terms and privacy policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Binance APIs:</strong> The dashboards you open may fetch market data directly from Binance endpoints. Requests are made by the webpage you open, not by the extension.</li>
    <li><strong>Donation link:</strong> The extension shows a static “Donation” link that opens your external payment page (e.g., PayPal). Payments are processed by that provider; this extension does not process or store payment data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. No Tracking or Analytics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No usage analytics or telemetry.</li>
    <li>No cookies or unique identifiers are set by the extension.</li>
    <li>No page contents are read or stored.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Incognito Mode</h2>
  <p>
    The extension can run in Incognito only if you enable it in Chrome. Behavior is the same as in regular mode;
    custom links are stored by Chrome in the appropriate profile storage and are not transmitted by the extension.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>
    All extension settings stay in your browser’s local/sync storage. There are no backend servers operated by this extension,
    and no passwords or payment information are handled by the extension.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Custom links persist until you change or remove them.</li>
    <li><strong>Manage:</strong> Use the Options page to add, reorder, or delete your custom links.</li>
    <li><strong>Uninstall:</strong> Removing the extension deletes its local and sync storage in Chrome.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Changes</h2>
  <p>
    As features evolve, this policy may be updated. The latest version will be published via the Chrome Web Store listing
    or the linked repository.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    For support or questions, contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store listing or the project’s GitHub repository.
  </p>

  <p><em>This extension is designed to comply with the Chrome Web Store privacy requirements.</em></p>
