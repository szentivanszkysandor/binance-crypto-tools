  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 25, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>“Binance – Crypto Tools &amp; Alert”</strong> Chrome extension provides a unified interface
    for monitoring live Binance Spot prices and using built-in HTML5 tools. It displays real-time
    <em>Price</em>, <em>RSI(14)</em>, <em>24h%</em>, and an <em>EMA Trend (20/50/200)</em> badge. It also includes
    cross-based <strong>Price Alerts</strong> with configurable <em>hysteresis</em> and <em>minimum repeat</em> intervals,
    optional audio cues, and multiple alert row display styles in the popup.
  </p>
  <p>
    The extension does not trade, manage wallets, or access private Binance accounts.
    It is an independent, unofficial project and is <strong>not affiliated with Binance</strong>.
    All data is informational and intended for educational and analytical purposes only.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>storage</strong><br>
      Used to save your configuration. Two stores are used:
      <ul>
        <li><code>chrome.storage.sync</code> — portable settings synced with your Google account if Chrome Sync is enabled.</li>
        <li><code>chrome.storage.local</code> — device-local cache and transient UI state.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>notifications</strong><br>
      Used to display Chrome notifications when a price alert fires. The notification text contains only alert context
      (symbol, direction, target, latest price/distance); no personal data is included.
    </li>
    <li><strong>alarms</strong><br>
      Used to schedule low-frequency background wakeups so the service worker can refresh essential market data and evaluate alerts,
      even when the popup is closed. No user tracking or scheduling of personal events.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Host permission</strong><br>
      <code>https://api.binance.com/*</code> — strictly used to fetch public, read-only market data (prices, klines for RSI/EMA/MACD/ATR, 24h stats, and Spot symbol list for autocomplete).
      No authentication, no account endpoints.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The extension does <strong>not</strong> request access to tabs, browsing history, webRequest interception, or other sensitive permissions.
  </p>

  <h3>2.1 Clipboard Use</h3>
  <p>
    When you click a “Copy address” button in the donation dialog, the extension writes the shown BNB (BEP20) address to your clipboard.
    It does not read clipboard contents and never accesses the clipboard without your direct click.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Audio Playback</h3>
  <p>
    The packaged file <code>assets/alert.wav</code> is played locally for alert sounds when the popup/expanded window is open and you have interacted once
    (Chrome’s autoplay policy). Audio can be muted via the “Mute alert sound” setting. The extension does not record audio and does not use the microphone.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Stored by the Extension</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>In chrome.storage.sync (portable settings):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Live Prices list</em>: your selected Spot symbols and their RSI timeframes, row order, and optional column toggles.</li>
        <li><em>Price Alerts</em>: per-row alert rules including <code>{ id, symbol, op (Above/Below), price (target), enabled, oneShot, createdAt }</code>.</li>
        <li><em>Alert behavior</em>: <code>muteAlerts</code>, <code>hystPct</code> (hysteresis tolerance), <code>minRepeatMs</code> (cooldown), <code>alertsStyle</code> (render style), and <code>hideAlerts</code>.</li>
        <li><em>UI prefs</em>: show/hide defaults, hide Live Prices section, Compact View, active Options tab, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>In chrome.storage.local (device-local):</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><em>symbolsCache</em>: the Binance Spot symbol list for autocomplete (timestamp + array), refreshed on demand or periodically.</li>
        <li><em>Minor UI state</em>: onboarding tip dismissal, open counters, other ephemeral flags.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Not stored:</strong> live prices, computed indicators, and alert fire events are processed in memory only and are not persisted.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Binance API Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The extension fetches <strong>public, anonymous market data</strong> directly from Binance:
      live prices, candlesticks (for local RSI/EMA/MACD/ATR), 24-hour stats, and the Spot symbol list for autocomplete.</li>
    <li>No Binance account login, API key, or authentication is required or used.</li>
    <li>All requests are read-only and contain no personal identifiers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. How Alerts Work (Privacy-Relevant Summary)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cross-based</strong>: an alert fires only when price crosses the target from the other side, considering your <em>hysteresis</em> setting.</li>
    <li><strong>Min repeat</strong>: enforces a cooldown between two fires of the same alert.</li>
    <li><strong>Once / Repeat</strong>: in 1× mode, an alert disables itself after the first fire; otherwise it re-arms after crossing back.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: the extension posts a Chrome notification with symbol and basic numbers; no personal data is included.</li>
    <li><strong>Audio</strong>: optional local playback of <code>alert.wav</code> in the popup/expanded window; can be muted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Binance APIs</strong> — market data comes directly from Binance. Refer to Binance’s own policies for their services.</li>
    <li><strong>Developer-hosted tools</strong> — the “Tools” buttons open static HTML pages (e.g., GitHub Pages). These pages do not receive data from the extension and operate independently, subject to their hosting provider’s policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Donations</strong> — optional Binance QR and PayPal links open external payment pages. The extension does not collect or store any payment information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. No Tracking or Analytics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No telemetry or usage analytics.</li>
    <li>No cookies or fingerprinting.</li>
    <li>No content script injection into third-party websites and no reading of web page content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Incognito Mode</h2>
  <p>
    The extension may be allowed to run in Incognito if you enable it in Chrome. Its privacy behavior is identical to normal mode.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All settings remain within Chrome’s extension storage (sync/local).</li>
    <li>All network requests use <strong>HTTPS</strong>.</li>
    <li>No backend servers; no handling of sensitive credentials or payment data.</li>
    <li>No remote code execution; the extension does not fetch or execute code from external sources.</li>
    <li>Notifications are delivered by Chrome/OS; their visibility on lock screens depends on your device settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Retention</strong>: your symbol list, alert rules, and preferences persist until you change or reset them.</li>
    <li><strong>Manage locally</strong>: use the Options page to edit or clear your configuration at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Uninstall</strong>: removing the extension deletes its data from your browser. If Chrome Sync is enabled, clearing synced data is managed by your Google account settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>11. Changes</h2>
  <p>
    If this policy changes due to feature updates or permission changes, the latest version will be available on the Chrome Web Store listing.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    For support or privacy questions, use the contact information provided on the Chrome Web Store listing.

  <h2>13. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This extension is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>14. No Financial Advice</h2>
  <p>
    The extension provides market data and tools for informational and educational purposes only. It does not constitute financial, investment, or trading advice. You are solely responsible for your trading decisions.
  </p>
