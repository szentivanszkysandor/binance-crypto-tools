  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 24, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>“Binance – Crypto Tools”</strong> Chrome extension provides a unified interface for monitoring live Binance crypto prices and using built-in HTML5 trading tools.
    It displays real-time <em>Price</em>, <em>RSI(14)</em>, and <em>24h%</em> updates (plus EMA Trend), and includes six optional tools like Order Book, Market Trades, and Macro/Crypto Risk dashboards.
  </p>
  <p>
    The extension itself does not trade, manage wallets, or access private Binance accounts.  
    It is an independent, unofficial project and is <strong>not affiliated with Binance</strong>.  
    All data is purely informational and intended for educational and analytical purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
